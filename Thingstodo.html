                     <p>Sri Lanka's southern tip nudges the depths of the continental shelf. <br>It;s an area favoured by blue whales and nowhere else does the world's biggest <br>creature swim so close to land, so reliably.

                        Dondra Head is your jumping off point. <br>From January to April, blue whales pass here on their route from the Bay of Bengal to the western Indian Ocean.<br> They fill their bellies on the krill and squid that thrive in these waters, enriched by the outfall of Sri Lanka's 103 rivers. Often spotted blue whales are the biggest animals in the world and Mirissa is the best place for whale and dolphin watching tour in Sri Lanka.<br> Whale watching season in Mirissa is from November to April.</p>
